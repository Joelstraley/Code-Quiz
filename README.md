# Code-Quiz

## Overview

The Code Quiz is initiated with the "Start Quiz" button. The quiz consists of 5 questions, populated randomly on the subject of JavaScript. Once a question is answered the term "correct" or "wrong" will appear at the bottom, the score will be increased by 1 for correct answers and time will be reduced by 10 seconds for incorrect answers. 

At the end of the quiz you can submit your initials. Your initials and score will be logged in local storage. You will then see the High Score board which will show all initials and scores that have been saved in local storage.
